# Peers

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

This project also uses a starter template created by Isaac Dyor, which can be found in his [blog post](https://dev.to/isaacdyor/t3-stack-with-app-router-and-supabase-jh9).

## Setup

1. Clone the project locally
2. Run `npm install`
3. Add a `.env` folder, and add the contents which were sent in the Discover server

## Contribution Guidelines

Please create a new branch for any changes. For consistency reasons, let's try to name our branches in the following format:

`XX_change_made` (**example:** ZB_added_event_creation)

Where XX is your first name and last name initials. The rest of the branch name should be a general indicator of the change made!

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.
