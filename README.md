# Peers

Peers is a web-application designed to improve peer-to-peer learning among university students. At its core, Peers is a social network platform, where students and organizations can host events not only in-person, but also directly online!

With its clever use of gamification, and personalized recommendations, Peers is designed as the next generation knowledge transfer platform.

The project is currently deployed at: https://peers-uf.vercel.app/

#### Testing

Tests are split into four different sections:

- Prettier - checks for code formatting
  - `npm run test:prettier`
- Eslint - checks for programmatic error, and stylistic errors
  - `npm run test:eslint`
- Unit - runs tests on backend API functions
  - `npm run test:prettier`
- E2e - tests system as a whole (frontend + backend)
  - `npm run test:prettier`

**Note:** Ensure that you have properly setup the testing `.env` variables (see appendix)

## Contribution Guidelines

Please create a new branch for any changes. For consistency reasons, please name your branches in the following format:

`XX_change_made` (**example:** ZB_added_event_creation)

Where XX is your first name and last name initials. The rest of the branch name should be a general indicator of the change made!
